# Media Upload Association and Search Functionality Fix

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive refactoring to fix media upload associations with activities and improve the search functionality in the media gallery.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Media Upload Association with Activities
**Problem**: Media uploads were not properly associated with activities, causing attachments to not show up linked to specific comments/activities.

**Solution**: 
- Updated the comments API route to properly associate uploaded media with the created activity
- Modified the media schema to include 'activity' as a valid association type
- Updated all relevant API routes to support 'activity' type associations

### 2. Media Gallery Search Functionality
**Problem**: Search filter in media gallery was disappearing when typing, causing poor user experience.

**Solution**:
- Added debouncing (300ms) to the search functionality to prevent excessive API calls
- Fixed the useEffect dependencies to properly handle search term changes
- Improved the search behavior to reset pagination when search criteria change

### 3. Activity Media Dropdown Feature
**Problem**: No way to view media files associated with specific activities.

**Solution**:
- Created a new `ActivityMediaDropdown` component that shows media files belonging to each activity
- Added conditional rendering - dropdown only appears if media exists for that activity
- Integrated the dropdown into both CustomerTicketDetail and SupportTicketDetail components

## Files Modified

### 1. API Routes
- `/workspace/app/api/tickets/[id]/comments/route.ts`
  - Added media parameter handling
  - Added media association logic with activities
  - Updated to associate media with activity after creation

- `/workspace/app/api/media/upload/route.ts`
  - Added 'activity' to allowed association types

- `/workspace/app/api/media/list/route.ts` 
  - Added 'activity' to allowed association types

- `/workspace/app/api/media/confirm/route.ts`
  - Added 'activity' to allowed association types

### 2. Database Layer
- `/workspace/lib/database.ts`
  - Added `updateActivity` method to support updating activities with attachments

### 3. Schemas
- `/workspace/lib/schemas/media.schema.ts`
  - Updated interface and schema to include 'activity' as valid association type

### 4. Components

#### New Component
- `/workspace/components/shared/ActivityMediaDropdown.tsx`
  - New component for displaying activity-specific media in a dropdown
  - Conditional rendering based on media availability
  - Lazy loading of media when dropdown is expanded
  - Download functionality for attached files

#### Updated Components
- `/workspace/components/shared/MediaGallery.tsx`
  - Fixed search functionality with debouncing
  - Improved useEffect dependencies for better performance
  - Enhanced pagination reset logic

- `/workspace/components/customer/CustomerTicketDetail.tsx`
  - Added ActivityMediaDropdown import
  - Integrated dropdown in activity display
  - Maintained existing styling and layout

- `/workspace/components/support/SupportTicketDetail.tsx`
  - Added ActivityMediaDropdown import
  - Integrated dropdown in activity display
  - Removed old manual media display logic
  - Cleaned up unused state variables and functions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Media Association Flow
1. User uploads media files during comment creation
2. Media files are initially associated with 'comment' type and ticket ID
3. When comment/activity is created, media association is updated:
   - `associatedWith.type` changed from 'comment' to 'activity'
   - `associatedWith.id` changed from ticket ID to activity ID
4. Activity attachments field is populated with media metadata
5. ActivityMediaDropdown component can now find and display the associated media

### Search Functionality Improvements
1. Added 300ms debounce to prevent excessive API calls while typing
2. Separated search term changes from other dependency changes
3. Reset pagination when search criteria change
4. Improved user experience with smooth search behavior

### Dropdown Component Features
1. **Conditional Rendering**: Only shows if media exists for the activity
2. **Lazy Loading**: Media is only fetched when dropdown is expanded
3. **Performance**: Initial check uses limit=1 to quickly determine if media exists
4. **User Experience**: Clear expand/collapse states with media count display
5. **File Management**: Download functionality for each attached file

## Benefits

1. **Proper Media Association**: Media files now correctly show up linked to their respective activities
2. **Improved User Experience**: Smooth search functionality without input field issues
3. **Better Organization**: Clear visual indication of which activities have attachments
4. **Performance**: Lazy loading and debouncing prevent unnecessary API calls
5. **Maintainability**: Clean component architecture with proper separation of concerns

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding media preview functionality to the dropdown
2. Implement media sorting within the dropdown
3. Add bulk media management features
4. Consider implementing real-time updates for media associations

## Validation

The changes maintain backward compatibility while adding the new functionality. All existing media associations continue to work, and the new activity associations provide the additional functionality requested.

The search functionality now works smoothly without the input field disappearing, and users can easily access media files associated with specific activities through the new dropdown interface.
